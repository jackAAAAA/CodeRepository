  <h2 style="text-align: center;">Callbacks</h2>
  <div>
   According to Wikipedia:
   <br>
  </div>
  <i>"In computer programming, a callback is a piece of executable code that is passed as an argument to other code, which is expected to call back (execute) the argument at some convenient time."</i>
  <div></div>
  <p>In other words, in Java, we can pass our functions (presented by objects) in a method/function as its arguments.</p>
  <p>Let's take an example. Since Java 8, any collection has the <b>forEach()</b> method. The method accepts <b>Consumer</b> and calls it for each element in the collection.</p>
  <pre><code>// our collection with fruits
List&lt;String&gt; fruits = Arrays.asList("apple", "pear", "orange", "banana");

// it will print all fruits in the collection
fruits.forEach(System.out::println);</code></pre> 
  <div>
   <b></b>Of course, we can pass a more difficult logic as a callback.
   <div>
    <br>
   </div>
   <div>
    <pre><code>fruits.forEach(fruit -&gt; {
    String doubleFruit = fruit.concat(fruit).toUpperCase();
    if (doubleFruit.length() &gt; 10) {
        System.out.println(doubleFruit);
    }
});</code></pre> 
    <br>
   </div>
   <div>
    The result is shown below.
   </div>
   <div>
    <pre><code>ORANGEORANGE
BANANABANANA</code></pre> 
   </div>
  </div>
  <div>

  </div>

   <b>Note</b>. In functional programming, a function (including methods in Java) that accepts or returns another function is called a 
   <b>higher-order function</b>. A lot of features such as 
   <b>function composition</b>, 
   <b>currying</b>, 
   <b>monads</b> and some others based on this idea.
