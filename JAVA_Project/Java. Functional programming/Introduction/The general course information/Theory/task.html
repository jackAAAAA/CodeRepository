  <h2 style="text-align: center;">The general course information</h2> 
  <p>Welcome to <strong>Java.Functional programming</strong> course!</p> 
  <p>The course introduces elements of functional programming in Java 8+ including lambda expressions and method references, functional interfaces and function objects, stream API and lazy evaluation, currying, and monads. It gives you a practical approach to programming without too theoretical aspects of functional programming such as the Category Theory :)</p> 
  <p>The course syllabus consists of several modules revealing different aspects of functional programming in Java. Each module contains 1-2 theoretical lessons and a set of practice exercises. Some of these exercises are marked as <strong>HARD</strong>. If you don't have plenty of time, you can just skip them.</p> 
  <p>To solve our code challenges, you do not need to write the <code>main</code> method and <strong>I/O operations</strong>. They will be added to your solutions automatically. Such an approach allows you to focus on the meaning of the assigned tasks and reduce the spent time on completing exercises.</p> 
  <p>By the way, an improved version of the lessons is also available on <a href="https://hyperskill.org" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Hyperskill</a> which is a new project-based educational platform supported by Stepik and JetBrains.</p>

  <p><strong>Note 1.</strong>&nbsp;For some historical reasons, all the theories and practice lessons here are separated, and each practice lesson consists of only one step unlike many other Stepik courses. There is no easy way to change this without losing the progress of our learners. We wouldn't like to do this, so please be understanding.</p> 
  <p><strong>Note 2.</strong>&nbsp;There are some mistakes in English in the course because 3 years ago the author didn't know English well enough to avoid them. But we are going to fix them soon. Anyway, the mistakes shouldn't reduce your understanding of the lessons.</p> 
  <p>If you have any questions or suggestions, write them in comments. Happy learning!</p>
