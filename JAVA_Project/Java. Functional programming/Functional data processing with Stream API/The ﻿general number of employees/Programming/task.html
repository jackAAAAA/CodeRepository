  <p>You have two classes: <b>Employee </b>(name: String, salary: Long)<b></b> and <b>Department </b>(name: String, code: String, employees: List&lt;Employee&gt;)<b></b>.<b></b> Both classes have getters for all fields with the corresponding names (getName(), getSalary(), getEmployees() and so on).</p>
  <p><b></b>W<b></b>rite a method using Stream API that calculates <b>the general</b> <b>number of employees </b>with <b>salary &gt;= threshold</b> for all departments whose code starts with string <b>"111-" </b>(without ""). Perhaps, <b>flatMap</b> method can help you to implement it.</p>
  <p>Classes<b> Employee</b> and <b>Department</b> will be available during testing. You can define your own classes for local testing.</p>
  <p><b>Important. </b>Use the given template for your method. Pay attention to type of an argument and the returned value. Please, use only Stream API, no cycles.</p>
  <p><b>Examples:</b> there are 2 departments (in JSON notation) below and ﻿threshold = 20 000. The result is 1 (because there is only one suitable employee).<br></p>
