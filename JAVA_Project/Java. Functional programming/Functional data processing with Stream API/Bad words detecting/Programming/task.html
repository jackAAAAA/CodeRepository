  <p>Create a stream that will detect bad words in a text according to a bad words list. All words in the text are divided by whitespaces (always only one whitespace between two words).<br></p>
  <p>After calling <b>collect(Collectors.toList())</b> the stream must return the list of bad words which were found in the text.<b> </b><b>The result should be dictionary ordered (in lexicographical order, i.e. sorted)</b><span> </span><b>and</b><span> </span><b>bad words shouldn't repeat.</b></p>
  <p><b>Important.</b> You need return a prepared stream from the template method, not a list of bad words. Pay attention to the method template. Do not change it!<br></p>
